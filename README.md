# Ray Tracing

This repo follows the [ray tracing books](https://raytracing.github.io/) as I code my own ray tracer from *scratch*.
While the source code for the final ray tracer is available, I did not look at it.

I chose using C instead of C++ (what the books suggest using) or Rust as I wanted to do a more substantial C project.


## How to view the rendered images
The rendered images are in the images folder.
We use the ppm format of writing some numbers to a file to describe the image.

You can use https://jumpshare.com/viewer/ppm to view the image (no download needed)
or this [VS Code extension] (what I used).

## Some Images
I converted some images from ppm to png, so they can be displayed here:
