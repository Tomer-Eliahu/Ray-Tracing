# Ray Tracing

This repo follows the [ray tracing books](https://raytracing.github.io/) as I code my own ray tracer from *scratch*.
While the source code for the final ray tracer is available, I did not look at it.

I chose using C instead of C++ (what the books suggest using) or Rust as I wanted to do a more substantial C project.
